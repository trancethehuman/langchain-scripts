Within workspaces, you can create reviews or packages for sharing. Workspaces can be organized by project, client, or other topics. Within a workspace, you can also create a folder structure to organize your uploaded files and reviews. It is advisable to standardize protocols around workspace creation, folder organization and nomenclature within your organization.&nbsp; CoLab's Start Page is your homebase for creating and accessing your workspaces. From there, you can also access the Track tab. In this article, we’ll cover the following: ‍ From the CoLab Start Page, click the ‘Create Workspace’ button or the ‘+ New’ button and select ‘Workspace’ from the dropdown list. In the ‘Create Workspace’ modal, you can add a workspace name, invite users and set their permission levels, copy a folder structure from an existing workspace, enable file downloading, and allow full access users to share files. You can maximize your CoLab setup by organizing your workspaces into folders. For example, if your company is planning to collaborate with external users in CoLab (i.e. with customers, suppliers, etc.), you may want to create folders to segregate your workspaces shared internally with your team vs. workspaces shared with external parties. From the CoLab Start Page, click on the ‘+New’ button and select ‘Workspace Folder’ from the dropdown list. Type in the name of your workspace folder and click ‘Save’. Your saved workspace folder will display in the list of workspaces below. Any workspaces within that folder will be nested underneath that folder name.&nbsp; ‍ You can move workspaces into a folder by right clicking on the workspace name and selecting ‘Move’. A modal will appear with the available folders where your workspace can be moved. Click on the desired folder and then select ‘Move’ in the lower right corner.&nbsp; Once a workspace is created, you can start uploading files to the workspace. You can create folders to organize your files, and we recommend creating a structure based on your organization’s best practices. You’ll also need to invite any CoLab users that you would like to have access to the assets within that workspace. More information on workspace and file management can be found in the <a href=\"https://help.colabsoftware.com/categories/file-management\">‘File Management’ </a>section of the CoLab knowledge base. If you’re already inside a Workspace, click on the Workspace title in the top left corner to get back to the Workspace Navigator. With the Workspace Navigator open, you can view the Recent Workspaces which you have accessed, View All Workspaces, or Search Workspaces.&nbsp; You can open, rename, view its settings, or delete a workspace by right clicking on the workspace name and selecting the preferred option. Note that you must be the workspace administrator in order to perform any of these actions. You can also view workspace settings by clicking the gear icon next to the workspace name in the ‘Recent Workspaces’ panel. You can rename, enable file downloading, upload a workspace icon, remember an assigned user when leaving feedback, allow Full Access users to share files, and delete the workspace from the workspace settings page. To complete a broader range of actions related to workspaces, you can navigate to the workspace management page by clicking the profile icon in the top right corner and select ‘My Profile.’ Click ‘Workspaces’ to navigate to the workspace management page. On this page you can search for and create workspaces. Clicking the icon to the right of the workspace allows you to open the workspace, access the workspace settings, and join the workspace.

You are presented with a list of Workspaces in CoLab to which you have access; selecting one of them shows you a list of files within that Workspace. If downloading is enabled in that workspace, you may download any Solidworks format files and open them in the active session. To share new Solidworks files in a Workspace, you can use the ‘Upload Current File’ option. This will create a new file in the selected CoLab workspace.&nbsp; To share a revision of an existing file in the Workspace, select the kebab icon beside relevant file and select the ‘New Version from Current File’ option. This will create a new revision of the file in the CoLab workspace, allowing you to track changes made over time.&nbsp; CoLab retrieves Solidworks file data that is saved to your local drive, so it is necessary to save your current model beforehand, so that the information pushed to CoLab is guaranteed to be current.&nbsp; <strong>For Solidworks + Solidworks PDM Environments</strong> The CoLab plugin retrieves the file data from your file system via Solidworks, but offers extended capability for users who are also using Solidworks PDM.&nbsp; For Solidworks installations alongside Solidworks PDM, the CoLab Solidworks Plugin retrieves additional version and revision number metadata that originates from the PDM client. If the part has never been checked in to PDM, no version or revision badge will be displayed in CoLab.&nbsp; An important note - the CoLab Solidworks plugin does not pull files directly from the Solidworks PDM Vault - it relies on the user to retrieve the latest CAD version of the file(s) from their PDM vault.&nbsp; This integration is intended to allow you to maintain a trace between the file version in CoLab and the file version in your Solidworks PDM Vault. If you choose to rename revisions within the CoLab web app, it will overwrite the version titles generated from PDM, so please exercise caution when doing so.&nbsp; You will now see a CoLab icon in the side panel on the right side of the SOLIDWORKS screen. Click the icon, and login. Once logged in, you will see a list of your workspaces, as shown below. After logging in, select the workspace to which you would like to upload files.

To share a new revision of an existing file in CoLab, simply re-share the new revision to the same Workspace. CoLab uses an ID value from Windchill to determine that the file has already been uploaded to that Workspace, and will create it as a new revision instead of a separate file. Your Windchill Administrator will need to do a one-time installation of the add-in on the Windchill server where you would like CoLab to be available. This typically involves installing and testing the add-in in an integration environment as a first step. CoLab’s integration team will work closely with your IT team to complete the installation process. The add-in does not get installed on end user computers. If there is a Windchill upgrade, the add-in needs to be updated by your Windchill Administrator.

Once feedback has been addressed, it should be closed out. When closing out feedback, this indicates to your team that the feedback has either been accepted and closed, or rejected and closed. To close feedback, there are two ways to do so: <strong>Option 1:</strong> Clicking the checkmark on the feedback card (in the viewer or feedback list) is the only way to close short-form feedback and the quickest way to close the long-form feedback as ‘Closed (Accepted)’. <strong>Option 2:</strong> From ‘Feedback Details,’ a status dropdown menu can be used to change the status ‍<br> <strong>Notes</strong> ‍","url":"https://help.colabsoftware.com/article/closing-feedback-in-a-workspace","title":"Closing Feedback in a Workspace"},{"content":"When feedback is provided, it’s often hard to validate that a piece of feedback was addressed in the new version or not.

Feedback and tasks will be opened in one version and ideally closed in the next; however, the reality is that not all feedback is immediately addressed and engineering teams don’t want to lose sight of it as they progress the design.  Using the <a href=\"http://help.colabsoftware.com/article/filtering-the-feedback-list\" target=\"_blank\">feedback filters</a>, a user can easily toggle on open feedback from previous versions to ensure that all feedback, actions and tasks are properly addressed throughout the design process.

To do so, the process is simple: Pro Tip: The filter selection you use will persist until a refresh, so if you switch files it’ll remember what you are looking to see.
