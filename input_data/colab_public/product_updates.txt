"content": "Keeping customer data secure and protected is important for any software company, but for CoLab it’s absolutely mission-critical. We serve engineering teams and large organizations where IP security is paramount. Because we’ve known that since day one, security has always been an immovable pillar in everything we do to build and grow CoLab. In fact, we often use the phrase “security as a solution” to describe our philosophy. Some teams might be fine with treating security standards as just another box to be checked off, but that’s never been the way we do things at CoLab. With our security-first approach to product development and infrastructure design, CoLab is built to the highest standards of security and data protection—and always will be. That’s why we’re proud to announce that <strong>CoLab has officially received a clean SOC 2® type 1 audit report with zero findings</strong>. So what does that mean? And why does it matter to anyone outside CoLab? Read on to find out! ‍ The SOC 2 framework is part of the System and Organization Controls (SOC) suite of services laid out by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). Designed for service organizations, including cloud-based SaaS companies like CoLab, it provides criteria for the controls and systems used to protect corporate and customer data. This allows organizations to build strong security programs by following the SOC 2 framework—but it also offers assurance to anyone outside the organization that the security standards in place have been vetted and verified. To meet SOC 2 requirements, organizations must undergo an external audit and receive a clean audit report. There are two types of SOC 2 reports: Essentially, a SOC 2 type 1 audit confirms that an organization’s security program meets the SOC 2 standards; a SOC 2 type 2 audit confirms that an organization is upholding those standards on an ongoing basis. SOC 2 type 2 reports are typically only valid for up to 12 months. To maintain SOC 2 status, a fresh audit and report is required each year. Pursuing the requirements for SOC 2 is not a small undertaking. So why did CoLab make it a priority? Simply put: we did it for our customers. CoLab’s mission is to accelerate the pace of engineering innovation. We can’t do that unless we make it easy for engineering teams to trust us with their sensitive IP and vital information. Data security is important to any business, but it’s particularly crucial for the large engineering organizations we serve. As an industry-recognized security framework, achieving the SOC 2 requirements gives our customers (and future customers) peace of mind. Since the SOC 2 audit process is conducted by a third-party accounting firm, our verified SOC 2 type 1 report lets customers feel confident that all the right security controls and features are in place to proactively keep their data safe. While this is indeed a milestone achievement for CoLab, it’s also great news for our customers and potential future customers. Some organizations have specific security requirements around SOC 2 reports. But even beyond that, working with vendors who are SOC 2 compliant offers significant value. When you choose a vendor who meets SOC 2 requirements, you gain the benefit of: <strong>Industry-recognized security standards</strong> <strong>Independent verification through an external audit</strong> <strong>Ease of doing business</strong> Companies that take the initiative to pursue SOC 2 are also sending a clear message about the importance they place on cybersecurity, information protection, and privacy. It’s a voluntary process that requires a significant commitment to achieve, and also to maintain. So when you’re doing business with a vendor who has a completed SOC 2 audit report, you can feel confident they take your security concerns as seriously as you do. Our completed SOC 2 type 1 audit report is only the beginning for CoLab. While we’re thrilled to achieve this milestone, we’re already working diligently to prepare for our next steps! We’re on track to achieve our SOC 2 type 2 audit report by the end of 2022. Furthermore, CoLab is also registered in the Government of Canada’s Controlled Goods Program (CGP) and we’re actively working towards CMMC/ITAR readiness (mid 2024). ‍ ‍ ‍<em>To learn more about CoLab's robust security program, visit our Security page",

"content": "There are three primary methods for SolidWorks file sharing to enable your engineering team to work together asynchronously: Pack and Go, SolidWorks PDM, and CoLab. Each has strengths in various use cases, but it is essential to balance those against known drawbacks to determine the best approach for collaborating in SolidWorks for a given project. Pack and Go is a SolidWorks module that collects the assemblies, components, drawings, and other design elements and compresses them into a zip file. Because the file contains the entire CAD package, this approach represents the easiest route to sharing CAD designs between team members. In zip file form, users can send it through email, a secure shared drive, or an FTP site. However, this method only captures a CAD design in one snapshot in time. Pack and Go does not consider versioning; it only takes the iteration saved in the cache instead of the latest revision. This limitation creates the opportunity for errors as an older component file collected in the Pack and Go file would cascade into assemblies and every file that uses that component. The approach also can not find files on a local drive. These limitations all inhibit version control. An improvement to mitigate the shortfall of Pack and Go is SolidWorks PDM. Like the Copy Tree tool,&nbsp; SolidWorks PDM serves a similar purpose but with one main difference: PDM does not retrieve data from the SolidWorks files. Instead, the feature queries the PDM database to record the latest file reference and version information. This step ensures you have the most recent version of the assembly parts as it queries the database first, then caches the newest version locally, in contrast to Pack and Go. The SolidWorks PDM feature still carries some opportunities, such as more difficult ease-of-use than Pack and Go. Furthermore, PDM takes substantial setup, requiring more time investment and higher-skilled expertise to implement it. In addition, sharing files outside your local network still introduces the potential for versioning errors.&nbsp; CoLab offers <a href=\"https://www.colabsoftware.com/integrations/solidworks-add-in\">native integration with SolidWorks</a> and SolidWorks PDM. This seamless implementation simplifies sharing and reviewing CAD data with your team, even if they don’t have a SolidWorks license. The native integration also permits CoLab to pull in relevant metadata for the CAD review team members. In addition, CoLab can share native or neutral file types and offers feedback within the file at specific locations. It also addresses the critical version control hurdle that the previous collaboration approaches do not. With CoLab, you can share and open native and neutral SolidWorks files. For example, SLDASM and SLDPRT are native files, while IGES, STEP, and STL are neutral. Another convenient feature is that CoLab does not require collaboration partners to have a SolidWorks license; they will be able to open native SolidWorks formats within the platform. This feature is significant because it ensures your data does not degrade during CAD collaboration. When you need to make changes to a CAD file, you can download the file from CoLab to SolidWorks directly from your SolidWorks session. Then, when you’ve made changes and are ready to get feedback, you can upload a new file or revision directly from your SolidWorks session into CoLab. In addition to sharing CAD, CoLab also lets you exchange feedback by pinning comments directly to drawings and models. By combining CAD files and design feedback in one place, the application simplifies reviews at timescales up to four times faster than other applications. Perhaps the most significant benefit of CoLab for SolidWorks file sharing is that unlike Pack and Go, CoLab lets you share models <em>while</em> keeping track of version history. This historical record is critical to asynchronous collaboration so the team can view how the design evolves and the order of changes applied to the model. This approach is similar to SolidWorks’s Copy Tree–with improved setup and ease of use. Collaborating in SolidWorks is essential to achieving efficient design convergence and approval. CoLab can provide asynchronous collaboration with version control and integrated feedback that companies like <a href=\"https://www.colabsoftware.com/case-studies/johnson-controls-builds-industry-leading-engineering-change-and-design-review-process\">Johnson Controls</a> have applied to deliver efficiency, quality, and clarity of collaborative engineering design efforts.",
